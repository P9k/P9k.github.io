	abstract = {Quantum chemical calculations using density functional theory at the BP86-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVPP level of theory are reported for transition metal compounds [TM]-L in high and low oxidation states involving carbene, carbyne, alkene, and alkyne ligands L. The nature of the [TM]-L bond is analyzed with the energy decomposition analysis - natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) method. The calculations reveal that transition metal compounds with ligands, that are typically classified as donor–acceptor complexes possessing dative bonds (Fischer-type carbenes and carbynes, alkene, and alkyne complexes) or as TM compounds with electron-sharing bonds (Schrock-type carbenes and carbynes, metallacyclopropanes, and metallacyclopropenes), exhibit significant differences between the orbital interactions when closed-shell or open shell fragments are used. Fischer-type carbene complexes have much lower orbital interaction (ΔEorb) values when singlet fragments are employed compared to triplet fragments. In contrast, singlet and triplet fragments of Schrock-type carbene complexes give similar ΔEorb values. The best description for Fischer-type carbyne complexes is found for neutral fragments in their electronic doublet state, which engage in a mixture of dative bonding (σ donation and π backdonation) and one electron-sharing π bond. The EDA-NOCV calculations of Schrock-type carbynes using open-shell species in their quartet electronic state give similar ΔEorb values as neutral fragments in their electronic doublet state. Alkene and alkyne complexes, but also metallacyclic species, are best described with singlet fragments, but the difference between the ΔEorb values for dative bonding and electron-sharing bonding using triplet fragments becomes much smaller for molecules that are considered as metallacycles.},

Aufgrund der außerordentlich kurzen Halbwertszeit von 0.69þÀ00::6242 ms für 219148Og[1] kçnnen Aussagen bezüglich chemischer und physikalischer Eigenschaften nur mittels relativistischer Quantentheorien gemacht werden. In dieser Arbeit verwenden wir zwei komplementäre Ansätze, um den Schmelz- und Siedepunkt dieses superschweren Elements akkurat zu bestimmen: Einerseits Simulationen auf Grundlage von Parallel Tempering Monte-Carlo (PTMC) und andererseits auf First-Principles basierender Thermodynamischer Integration (TI), die beide mithilfe von hoch genauen CoupledCluster-Rechnungen kalibriert worden sind. In hervorragender Übereinstimmung miteinander sagen beide Methoden voraus, dass Og unter Normalbedingungen ein Feststoff mit einem Schmelzpunkt von \% 325 K ist. Ohne Berücksichtigung der relativistischen Effekte wäre Og mit einem Schmelzpunkt von 220 K gasfçrmig, wie es für ein typisches Edelgaselement zu erwarten wäre. Demnach verschieben relativistische Effekte den Fest-Flüssig-Phasenübergang um etwa 100 K.},

	abstract = {Oganesson (Og) is the last entry into the Periodic Table completing the seventh period of elements and group 18 of the noble gases. Only five atoms of Og have been successfully produced in nuclear collision experiments, with an estimate half-life for 219148Og of 0.69þÀ00::6242 ms.[1] With such a short lifetime, chemical and physical properties inevitably have to come from accurate relativistic quantum theory. Here, we employ two complementary computational approaches, namely parallel tempering Monte-Carlo (PTMC) simulations and first-principles thermodynamic integration (TI), both calibrated against a highly accurate coupled-cluster reference to pin-down the melting and boiling points of this super-heavy element. In excellent agreement, these approaches show Og to be a solid at ambient conditions with a melting point of \% 325 K. In contrast, calculations in the nonrelativistic limit reveal a melting point for Og of 220 K, suggesting a gaseous state as expected for a typical noble gas element. Accordingly, relativistic effects shift the solid-to-liquid phase transition by about 100 K.},

Compound 1 consisted of two C(s)-symmetric molecular isomers, as revealed by NMR spectroscopy, at which distinct site-preferences related to the Ga and Zn positions were observed by quantum-chemical calculations. Structural characterization of compound 1 showed significantly different coordination environments for both palladium centers. Whilst one Pd atom sat in the central of a bi-capped trigonal prism, thereby resulting in a formal 18-valence electron fragment, \{Pd(ZnMe)(2)(ZnCp*)(4)(GaMe)\}, the other Pd atom occupied one capping unit, thereby resulting in a highly unsaturated 12-valence electron fragment, \{Pd(GaCp*)\}. The bonding situation, as determined by atoms-in-molecules analysis (AIM), NBO partial charges, and molecular orbital (MO) analysis, pointed out that significant Pd-Pd interactions had a large stake in the stabilization of this unusual molecule. The characterization and quantum-chemical calculations of compound 1 revealed distinct similarities to related M/Zn/Ga Hume-Rothery intermetallic solid-state compounds, such as Ga/Zn-exchange reactions, the site-preferences of the Zn/Ga positions, and direct M-M bonding, which contributes to the overall stability of the metal-rich compound.},

Compound 1 has been fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and liquid injection field desorption ionization mass spectrometry. It consists of an unusual [PdZn7] metal core and exhibits a terminal \{Zn(tmeda)\} unit. The bonding situation of 1 with respect to the properties of the three different types of Zn ligands Zn(R,L) (R = CH3, Cp*; L = tmeda) bonded to the Pd center was studied by density functional theory quantum chemical calculations. The results of energy decomposition and atoms in molecules analysis clearly point out significant differences according to R vs L. While Zn(CH3) and ZnCp* can be viewed as 1e donor Zn(I) ligands, \{Zn(tmeda)\} is best described as a strong 2e Zn(0) donor ligand.

Here, we report the synthesis of a bis(imidazolidin-2-iminato)phosphinonitrene, which is stable at room temperature in solution and can even be isolated in the solid state. The bonding between phosphorus and nitrogen is analogous to that observed for metallonitrenes. We also show that this nitrido phosphorus derivative can be used to transfer a nitrogen atom to organic fragments, a difficult task for transition metal-nitrido complexes.},

Accordingly, a Ga/Zn mixed compound [\{Cp*Ru(GaCp*)(ZnCp*)(ZnCl)2\}2] can be obtained if the amount of ZnMe2 is reduced so that one GaCp* remains coordinated to the transition metal. All new compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy as well as by single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques, if applicable. The coordination polyhedra of [Cp*M(ZnR)5] can be derived from the pseudo homoleptic parent compound [Ru(ZnCp*)4(ZnMe)6], as emphasized by continuous shape measures analysis (CShM). Computational investigations at the density functional theory (DFT) level of theory were performed, revealing no significant attractive interaction of the zinc atoms and therefore these compounds are best described as classical complexes, rather than cluster compounds.

	abstract = {The ground electronic state of C(BH)2 exhibits both a linear minimum and a peculiar angle-deformation isomer with a central B-C-B angle near 90°. Definitive computations on these species and the intervening transition state have been executed by means of coupled-cluster theory including single and double excitations (CCSD), perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), and full triples with perturbative quadruples (CCSDT(Q)), in concert with series of correlation-consistent basis sets (cc-pVXZ, X=D, T, Q, 5, 6; cc-pCVXZ, X=T, Q). Final energies were pinpointed by focal-point analyses (FPA) targeting the complete basis-set limit of CCSDT(Q) theory with auxiliary core correlation, relativistic, and non-Born–Oppenheimer corrections. Isomerization of the linear species to the bent form has a minuscule FPA reaction energy of 0.02 kcal mol−1 and a corresponding barrier of only 1.89 kcal mol−1. Quantum tunneling computations reveal interconversion of the two isomers on a timescale much less than 1 s even at 0 K. Highly accurate CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ and composite c∼CCSDT(Q)/cc-pCVQZ anharmonic vibrational frequencies confirm matrix-isolation infrared bands previously assigned to linear C(BH)2 and provide excellent predictions for the heretofore unobserved bent isomer. Chemical bonding in the C(BH)2 species was exhaustively investigated by the atoms-in-molecules (AIM) approach, molecular orbital plots, various population analyses, local mode vibrations and force constants, unified reaction valley analysis (URVA), and other methods. Linear C(BH)2 is a cumulene, whereas bent C(BH)2 is best characterized as a carbene with little carbone character. Weak B–B attraction is clearly present in the unusual bent isomer, but its strength is insufficient to form a CB2 ring with a genuine boron–boron bond and attendant AIM bond path.},

On the contrary, the contribution of P–P π bonding to the chemical bond in P2 is even higher than the contribution of N–N π bonding to the chemical bond in N2. The higher stability of P4 (T d) and the much lower stability of N4 (T d) with regard to the diatomic species come from the substantially larger weakening of the N–N σ-bonds compared with the P–P σ-bonds in the tetrahedral species. The sum of the six P–P σ-bond energies in P4 is higher than the sum of two σ- and four π-bonds in two P2, but the six N–N σ-bonds in N4 are weaker than two σ- and four π-bonds in two N2. The crucial factor that leads to the weak N–N bonds in N4, is the rather long N–N bonds which are 32.8 \% longer than in N2. In contrast, the P–P bonds in P4 are only 16.2 \% longer than in P2. Since the equilibrium distances in E2 and E4 are determined by Pauli repulsion, it can be concluded that the origin for the different stabilities of N4 and P4 relative to the diatomic molecules is the exchange repulsion. The nitrogen atoms encounter stronger Pauli repulsion, because the 2s and 2p valence orbitals have a similar radius while the 3s and 3p radii are more different.},

Two separated VSCCs present in the non-bonding region of the central silicon are indicative for two lone pairs. In the experiment, both the two crystallographically independent Si-C bond lengths and ellipticities vary notably. It is only the cyclohexyl derivative that shows significant differences in these values, both in the silylones and the germylones. Only by calculating increasing spheres of surrounding point charges we were able to recover the changes in the properties of the charge density distribution caused by weak intermolecular interactions. The nitrogen-carbene-carbon bond seems to have a significant double-bond character, indicating a singlet state for the carbene carbon, which is needed for donor acceptor bonding. Thus the sum of bond angles at the nitrogen atoms seems to be a reasonable estimate for singlet versus triplet state of cAACs.},

Compounds 1-Zn and 1-Ga are very closely related and differ only by one Zn or Ga atom in the group 12/13 metal shell (Zn/Ga) around the two Ni centers. Accordingly, 1-Zn is EPR-active and 1-Ga is EPR-silent. The compounds were derived as a crystalline product mixture. All new compounds were characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometric analysis using liquid-injection field desorption ionization, and elemental analysis, and their molecular structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. In addition, the electronic structure has been investigated by DFT and QTAIM calculations, which suggest that there is a Ni1-Ni2 binding interaction. Similar to Zn-rich intermetallic phases of the Hume-Rothery type, the transition metals (here Ni) are distributed in a matrix of Zn atoms to yield highly Zn-coordinated environments. The organic residues, ancillary ligands (Me, Cp*, and toluene), can be viewed as the "protecting" shell of the 10-metal-atom core structures.

In contrast, the metal–ligand interactions in [TM(cAAC)2] involve the TM atoms in the excited 1P state yielding strong TM p(π) → (cAAC)2 π backdonation, which is absent in the cations.

The trend for the bond strength in the neutral and charged adducts without relativistic effects becomes Cu {\textgreater} Ag {\textgreater} Au.

Through metallation of the mixture, the deprotonated species of both compounds could be obtained and isolated. Further reactions between the two metallated cyclic diarsanylsiloxanes (compounds 9 and 10) and (ClSiiPr2)2O both lead to the bicyclic compound As2- [(iPr2Si)2O]2 (11). Subsequent oxidative coupling of 9 or 10 with C2H4Br2 as reagent leads to intermolecular As–As bond formation, yielding the quite remarkable compound As6- [(iPr2Si)2O]3 (12), which features two siloxane-bridged As3 rings.

	abstract = {The analysis of NEXAFS spectra acquired at the absorption edge of heteroatoms like fluorine, nitrogen, or oxygen enables the determination of the molecular orientation of individual compounds even in multinary structures. Such an analysis requires detailed knowledge about the nature of the corresponding electronic excitations, especially because 1s-π* and 1s-σ* excitations frequently feature disparate transition dipole moments in planar molecules. Unlike intuitively assumed, the resulting dichroisms of both excitation types in planar systems are, however, not necessarily inverted. Instead, both the structure of the molecules and their alignment on the substrate determine the actual dichroisms. In this study, the NEXAFS signature and dichroisms of thin films of the organic n-type semiconductor perfluoropentacene (PFP) in different crystalline orientations at the carbon and fluorine absorption K-edge are thoroughly analyzed. For lying molecular orientations, an inverted dichroism at the fluorine K-edge compared to the carbon K-edge is found. In contrast, for upright molecular configurations the dichroisms at both absorption edges are similar. With the help of density functional theory methods, this behavior is explained by the different nature of the excitations. While at the carbon K-edge 1s-π* excitations are most prominent, 1s-σ*-related signals are dominant at the fluorine K-edge. Computations of the NEXAFS signatures and corresponding excitations at different levels of theory are compared with particular focus on electronic relaxation. Energetic positions and oscillator strengths, especially for resonances of σ*-type, depend strongly on the theoretical approach whereas the π*-related signals are barely affected by the methods applied in the present work. Similar effects were also found for the analysis of the smaller perfluoronaphthalene and are explained by the different relaxation effects for 1s-σ*- and 1s-π*-type excitations. As the investigated acenes are representative model systems for π-conjugated molecular semiconductors, the present findings are important for the understanding of the electronic properties and the application of NEXAFS for structural analysis in such materials.},

	abstract = {The analogy between ZnR fragments and the hydrogen radical represents a fruitful concept in organometallic synthesis. The organozinc(II) and -zinc(I) sources ZnMe2 (Me ¼ methyl) and [Zn2Cp*2] (Cp* ¼ pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) provide one-electron fragments \$ZnR (R ¼ Me, Cp*), which can be trapped by transition metal complexes [LaM], yielding [Lb(ZnR)n]. The addition of the dizinc compound [Zn2Cp*2] to coordinatively unsaturated [LaM] by the homolytic cleavage of the Zn–Zn bond can be compared to the classic oxidative addition reaction of H2, forming dihydride complexes [LaM(H)2]. It has also been widely shown that dihydrogen coordinates under preservation of the H–H bond in the case of certain electronic properties of the transition metal fragment. The s-aromatic triangular clusters [Zn3Cp*3]+ and [Zn2CuCp*3] may be regarded as the first indication of this so far unknown, side-on coordination mode of [Zn2Cp*2]. With this background in mind the question arises if a series of complexes featuring the Zn2M structural motif can be prepared exhibiting a (more or less) intact Zn–Zn interaction, i.e. di-zinc complexes which are analogous to non-classical dihydrogen complexes of the Kubas type. In order to probe this idea, a series of interrelated organozinc nickel and palladium complexes and clusters were synthesized and characterized as model compounds: [Ni(ZnCp*)(ZnMe)(PMe3)3](1), [Ni(ZnCp*)2(ZnMe)2(PMe3)2](2), [\{Ni(CNtBu)2(m2-ZnCp*)(m2-ZnMe)\}2](3), [Pd(ZnCp*)4(CNtBu)2](4) and [Pd3Zn6(PCy3)2(Cp*)4](5). The dependence of Zn/Zn interactions as a function of the ligand environments and the metal centers was studied. Experimental X-ray crystallographic structural data and DFT calculations support the analogy between dihydrogen and dizinc transition metal complexes.},

Relativity substantially stabilizes the direct metal−metal bonded system obtaining the sequence in M−M bond stability Au {\textgreater} Ag {\textgreater} Cu. In the ligand-bridged structure, an asymmetric bonding situation is obtained for gold, resulting in two stronger/covalent and two weaker/ionic bonds per gold atom.

	abstract = {The reaction mechanism for the rearrangement of the nitrate anion to its cis and trans peroxonitrite isomers is investigated in detail by quantum theoretical methods. The electronic ground state potential energy hypersurface (PES) features a bifurcation point along the minimum energy path at high energy, while the intrinsic reaction path moves the bifurcation point towards the transition state (TS) between the two peroxynitrite isomers. Coupled-cluster calculations reveal a high-lying transition state (4.6 eV) for the major photochemical isomerization pathway via an S1/S0 conical intersection, explaining why electronic excitation of the bright singlet states with λ=200–270 nm is required to trigger formation of peroxinitrite, while excitation of the weak band around 300 nm (wavelengths {\textgreater}270 nm) does instead lead to non-radiative regeneration of NO3−. The influence of the aqueous solution is considered using polarizable continuum solvation in combination with explicitly solvated model systems. Despite the charged and polar nature of nitrate, we find that solvent effects exert a suprisingly small influence, neither changing the shape of the PES, nor affecting the nature of the excited states.},

To address the issue, we explore the electronic structure of bulk Og by means of relativistic Kohn–Sham density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory in the form of the GW method. Calculating the band structure of the noble-gas solids from Ne to Og, we demonstrate excellent agreement for the band gaps of the experimentally known solids from Ne to Xe and provide values of 7.1 eV and 1.5 eV for the unknown solids of Rn and Og. While this is in line with periodic trends for Rn, the band gap of Og completely breaks with these trends. The surprisingly small band gap of Og moreover means that, in stark contrast to all other noble-gas solids, the solid form of Og is a semiconductor.},

From these interaction potentials, spectroscopic constants for the oganesson dimer and solid-state properties were obtained. Furthermore, these high-level results are compared to scalarrelativistic and two-component plane-wave DFT calculations based on a tailor-made projector augmented wave pseudopotential (PAW-PP) and newly derived parameters for Grimme’s dispersion correction. It is shown that the functionals PBE-D3(BJ), PBEsol, and in particular SCAN provide excellent agreement with the many-body reference for solid oganesson.

By using energy decomposition analysis, it is demonstrated that a strong M−E bond is accompanied by weak P−E bonds, and vice versa. Although the Al−M bond is, for example, found to be very strong, the weak Al−P bond suggests that the corresponding metal complexes will not be stable towards phosphine dissociation. The interaction energies for the boron(I)-based ligand are lower, but still higher than those for two-carbon-based ligands. For neutral ligands, electrostatic interactions are the dominating contributions to metal–ligand bonding, whereas for the cationic ligand a significant destabilization, with weak orbital and even weaker electrostatic metal–ligand interactions, is observed. Finally, for iron(II) complexes, it is demonstrated that different reactivity patterns are expected for the four donor groups: the experimentally observed reversible E−H reductive elimination of the borylene-based ligand (E=BH) exhibits significantly higher barriers for the protonated carbodiphosphorane (CDP) ligand (E=CH) and would proceed through different intermediates and transition states. For aluminum, such reaction pathways are not feasible (E=AlH). Moreover, it is demonstrated that the metal hydrido complexes with CDP ligands might not be stable towards reduction and isomerization to a protonated CDP ligand and a reduced metal center.},

	abstract = {The Cu-catalyzed reaction of substituted α-diazoesters with fluoride gives α-fluoroesters with ee values of up to 95 \%, provided that chiral indane-derived bis(oxazoline) ligands are used that carry bulky benzyl substituents at the bridge and moderately bulky isopropyl groups on their core. The apparently homogeneous solution of CsF in C6F6/hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) is the best reaction medium, but CsF in the biphasic mixture CH2Cl2/HFIP also provides good results. DFT studies suggest that fluoride initially attacks the Cu- rather than the C-atom of the transient donor/acceptor carbene intermediate. This unusual step is followed by 1,2-fluoride shift; for this migratory insertion to occur, the carbene must rotate about the Cu−C bond to ensure orbital overlap. The directionality of this rotatory movement within the C2-symmetric binding site determines the sense of induction. This model is in excellent accord with the absolute configuration of the resulting product as determined by X-ray diffraction using single crystals of this a priori wax-like material grown by capillary crystallization.},

These high-level data were subsequently fitted to computationally efficient extended Lennard-Jones and extended Axilrod-Teller-Muto types of interaction potentials. Solid-state calculations demonstrate that the many-body decomposition of the interaction energy converges well for the heavier rare gas solids, leading to solid-state properties in good agreement with experiment. The results show that it suffices to include two- and three-body interactions only for the melting simulation. The melting of the bulk is simulated for cells with cubic periodic boundary conditions, as well as within a finite cluster approach. For the latter, melting of spherical magic number clusters with increasing cluster size is studied, and the melting temperatures are obtained from extrapolation to the bulk. The calculated melting temperatures for the cluster extrapolation (the periodic approach values corrected for superheating are set in parentheses) are Tm=113.7 K (110.9 K) and Tm=160.8 K (156.1 K) for krypton and xenon, respectively.

	abstract = {To improve understanding of M−L bonds in 3d transition metal complexes, analysis by energy decomposition analysis and natural orbital for chemical valence model (EDA-NOCV) is desirable as it provides a full, quantitative and chemically intuitive ab initio description of the M−L interactions. In this study, a generally applicable fragmentation and computational protocol was established and validated by using octahedral spin crossover (SCO) complexes, as the transition temperature (T1/2) is sensitive to subtle changes in M−L bonding. Specifically, EDA-NOCV analysis of Fe−N bonds in five [FeII(Lazine)2(NCBH3)2], in both low-spin (LS) and paramagnetic high-spin (HS) states led to: 1) development of a general, widely applicable, corrected M+L6 fragmentation, tested against a family of five LS [FeII(Lazine)3](BF4)2 complexes; this confirmed that three Lazine are stronger ligands (ΔEorb,σ+π=−370 kcal mol−1) than 2 Lazine+2 NCBH3 (=−335 kcal mol−1), as observed. 2) Analysis of Fe−L bonding on LS→HS, reveals more ionic (ΔEelstat) and less covalent (ΔEorb) character (ΔEelstat:ΔEorb 55:45 LS→64:36 HS), mostly due to a big drop in σ (ΔEorb,σ ↓50 \%; −310→−145 kcal mol−1), and a drop in π contributions (ΔEorb,π ↓90 \%; −30→−3 kcal mol−1). 3) Strong correlation of observed T1/2 and ΔEorb,σ+π, for both LS and HS families (R2=0.99 LS, R2=0.95 HS), but no correlation of T1/2 and ΔΔEorb,σ+π(LS-HS) (R2=0.11). Overall, this study has established and validated an EDA-NOCV protocol for M−L bonding analysis of any diamagnetic or paramagnetic, homoleptic or heteroleptic, octahedral transition metal complex. This new and widely applicable EDA-NOCV protocol holds great promise as a predictive tool.},

EDA-NOCV on the sixteen LS complexes revealed that neither ΔEorb,σ+π (R2=0.48) nor ΔEorb,π (R2=0.31) correlated with the experimental solution T1/2 values (which are expected to reflect the ligand field imposed on the iron centre), but that ΔEorb,σ correlates well (R2=0.82) and implies that as X changes from EDG→EWG (Electron Donating to Withdrawing Group), the ligand becomes a better σ-donor. This counter-intuitive result was further probed by Mulliken analysis of the NA atomic orbitals: NA(px) involved in the Fe−N σ-bond vs. the perpendicular NA(pz) employed in the ligand aromatic π-system. As X changes EDG→EWG, the electron population on NA(pz) decreases, making it a better π-acceptor, whilst that in NA(px) increases, making it a better σ-bond donor; both increase ligand field, and T1/2 as observed. In 2016, Halcrow, Deeth and co-workers proposed an intuitively reasonable explanation of the effect of the para-X substituents on the

T1/2 values in this family of complexes, consistent with the calculated MO energy levels, that M→L π-backdonation dominates in these M−L bonds. Here the quantitative EDA-NOCV analysis of the M−L bond contributions provides a more complete, coherent and detailed picture of the relative impact of M−L σ-versus π-bonding in determining the observed T1/2, refining the earlier interpretation and revealing the importance of the σ-bonding. Furthermore, our results are in perfect agreement with the ΔE(HS-LS) vs. σp+(X) correlation reported in their work.},

Employing the OpenCalphad software, the thermodynamics of the (FeTi)1−𝑥H𝑥 (0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 1) system were assessed as a key basis for modeling hydrogenation of FeTi-based alloys. New thermodynamic data were acquired from our experimental pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) curves, as well as first-principles calculations utilizing density functional theory (DFT). The thermodynamic phase models were carefully selected based on critical analysis of literature information and ab-initio investigations. Key thermodynamic properties such as dissociation pressure, formation enthalpies and phase diagrams were calculated in good agreement to our performed experiments and literature-reported data. This work provides an initial perspective, which can be extended to account for higher-order thermodynamic assessments and subsequently enables the design of novel FeTi-based hydrides. In addition, the assessed thermodynamic data can serve as key inputs for kinetic models and hydride microstructure simulations.},

In this context, the influence of temperature and particle size of TiFeMn on the activation process is systematically studied. The results obtained from this investigation suggest that the activation of the TiFeMn material at temperatures as low as 50 °C is already possible, with a combination of “Dynamic” and “Static” routines, and that an increase to 90 °C strongly reduces the incubation time for activation, i.e. the incubation time of the sample with the two routines at 90 °C is about 0.84 h, while ∼ 277 h is required for the sample treated at 50 °C in both “Dynamic” and “Static” sequences. Selecting TiFeMn particles of larger size also leads to significant improvements in the activation performance of the investigated material. The proposed activation routine makes it possible to overcome the oxide layer existing on the compound surface, which acts as a diffusion barrier for the hydrogen atoms. This activation method induces further cracks and defects in the powder granules, gen­ erating new surfaces for hydrogen absorption with greater frequency, and thus leading to faster sorption kinetics in the subsequent absorption-desorption cycles.},

	abstract = {As early as 1975, Pitzer suggested that copernicium, flerovium, and oganesson are volatile substances behaving like noble gas because of their closed-shell configurations and accompanying relativistic effects. It is, however, precarious to predict the chemical bonding and physical behavior of a solid by knowledge of its atomic or molecular properties only. Copernicium and oganesson have been analyzed very recently by our group. Both are predicted to be semiconductors and volatile substances with rather low melting and boiling points, which may justify a comparison with the noble gas elements. Here, we study closed-shell flerovium in detail to predict its solid-state properties, including the melting point, by decomposing the total energy into many-body forces derived from relativistic coupled-cluster theory and from density functional theory. The convergence of such a decomposition for flerovium is critically analyzed, and the problem of using density functional theory is highlighted. We predict that flerovium in many ways does not behave like a typical noble gas element despite its closed-shell 7p21/2 configuration and resulting weak interactions. Unlike the case of noble gases, the many-body expansion in terms of the interaction energy does not converge smoothly. This makes the accurate prediction of phase transitions very difficult. Nevertheless, a first prediction by Monte Carlo simulation estimates the melting point at 284 ± 50 K. Furthermore, calculations for the electronic bandgap suggests that flerovium is a semiconductor similar to copernicium.},

	abstract = {The crystal structure of gold(II) sulfate is strikingly different from other coinage metal(II) sulfates. Central to the unsual AuSO4 bulk structure is the Au24+ ion with a very close Au−Au contact, which is a structural feature that does not appear in CuSO4 and AgSO4. To shed some light on this unusual behavior, we decided to investigate the relative stabilities of the coinage metal(II) sulfates utilizing periodic Density Functional Theory. By computing relative energies of the hypothetical nonrelativistic gold(II) sulfate (AuNRSO4) in different structural arrangements and performing chemical bonding analyses employing the Electron Localization Function as well as the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules method, we show that the stability of the unsual AuSO4 bulk structure can be related to aurophilic interactions enabled by relativistic effects. From the relative stabilities and UV−vis spectra computed via GW methodology, we predict that AuNRSO4 would assume the structure of either copper(II) sulfate or silver(II) sulfate with almost equal likelihood and appear as bright-violet or deepblue substances, respectively.},
