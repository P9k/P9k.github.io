    abstract    = {FeTi-based hydrides have recently re-attracted attention as stationary hydrogen storage materials due to favorable reversibility, good sorption kinetics and relatively low costs compared to alternative intermetallic hydrides. Employing the OpenCalphad software, the thermodynamics of the (FeTi)1‚àíùë•Hùë• (0 ‚â§ ùë• ‚â§ 1) system were assessed as a key basis for modeling hydrogenation of FeTi-based alloys. New thermodynamic data were acquired from our experimental pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) curves, as well as first-principles calculations utilizing density functional theory (DFT). The thermodynamic phase models were carefully selected based on critical analysis of literature information and ab-initio investigations. Key thermodynamic properties such as dissociation pressure, formation enthalpies and phase diagrams were calculated in good agreement to our performed experiments and literature-reported data. This work provides an initial perspective, which can be extended to account for higher-order thermodynamic assessments and subsequently enables the design of novel FeTi-based hydrides. In addition, the assessed thermodynamic data can serve as key inputs for kinetic models and hydride microstructure simulations.},

    abstract  = {The ground electronic state of C(BH)2 exhibits both a linear minimum and a peculiar angle-deformation isomer with a central B-C-B angle near 90¬∞. Definitive computations on these species and the intervening transition state have been executed by means of coupled-cluster theory including single and double excitations (CCSD), perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), and full triples with perturbative quadruples (CCSDT(Q)), in concert with series of correlation-consistent basis sets (cc-pVXZ, X=D, T, Q, 5, 6; cc-pCVXZ, X=T, Q). Final energies were pinpointed by focal-point analyses (FPA) targeting the complete basis-set limit of CCSDT(Q) theory with auxiliary core correlation, relativistic, and non-Born‚ÄìOppenheimer corrections. Isomerization of the linear species to the bent form has a minuscule FPA reaction energy of 0.02‚ÄÖkcal‚Äâmol‚àí1 and a corresponding barrier of only 1.89‚ÄÖkcal‚Äâmol‚àí1. Quantum tunneling computations reveal interconversion of the two isomers on a timescale much less than 1‚ÄÖs even at 0‚ÄÖK. Highly accurate CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ and composite c‚àºCCSDT(Q)/cc-pCVQZ anharmonic vibrational frequencies confirm matrix-isolation infrared bands previously assigned to linear C(BH)2 and provide excellent predictions for the heretofore unobserved bent isomer. Chemical bonding in the C(BH)2 species was exhaustively investigated by the atoms-in-molecules (AIM) approach, molecular orbital plots, various population analyses, local mode vibrations and force constants, unified reaction valley analysis (URVA), and other methods. Linear C(BH)2 is a cumulene, whereas bent C(BH)2 is best characterized as a carbene with little carbone character. Weak B‚ÄìB attraction is clearly present in the unusual bent isomer, but its strength is insufficient to form a CB2 ring with a genuine boron‚Äìboron bond and attendant AIM bond path.},

    abstract  = {The synthesis, structural characterization, and bonding situation analysis of a novel, all-zinc, hepta-coordinated palladium complex [Pd(ZnCp*)4(ZnMe)2\{Zn(tmeda)\}] (1) is reported. The reaction of the substitution labile d10 metal starting complex [Pd(CH3)2(tmeda)] (tmeda = N,N,N‚Ä≤,N‚Ä≤-tetramethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine) with stoichiometric amounts of [Zn2Cp*2] (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) results in the formation of [Pd(ZnCp*)4(ZnMe)2\{Zn(tmeda)\}] (1) in 35\% yield. Compound 1 has been fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and liquid injection field desorption ionization mass spectrometry. It consists of an unusual [PdZn7] metal core and exhibits a terminal \{Zn(tmeda)\} unit. The bonding situation of 1 with respect to the properties of the three different types of Zn ligands Zn(R,L) (R = CH3, Cp*; L = tmeda) bonded to the Pd center was studied by density functional theory quantum chemical calculations. The results of energy decomposition and atoms in molecules analysis clearly point out significant differences according to R vs L. While Zn(CH3) and ZnCp* can be viewed as 1e donor Zn(I) ligands, \{Zn(tmeda)\} is best described as a strong 2e Zn(0) donor ligand. Thus, the 18 valence electron complex 1 nicely fits to the family of metal-rich molecules of the general formula [M(ZnR)a(GaR)b] (a + 2b = n ‚â• 8; M = Mo, Ru, Rh; Ni, Pd, Pt; R = Me, Et, Cp*).},

    abstract  = {The synthesis, characterization, and theoretical investigation by means of quantum-chemical calculations of an oligonuclear metal-rich compound are presented. The reaction of homoleptic dinuclear palladium compound [Pd(2)(Œº-GaCp*)(3)(GaCp*)(2)] with ZnMe(2) resulted in the formation of unprecedented ternary Pd/Ga/Zn compound [Pd(2)Zn(6)Ga(2)(Cp*)(5)(CH(3))(3)] (1), which was analyzed by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy, MS, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 1 consisted of two C(s)-symmetric molecular isomers, as revealed by NMR spectroscopy, at which distinct site-preferences related to the Ga and Zn positions were observed by quantum-chemical calculations. Structural characterization of compound 1 showed significantly different coordination environments for both palladium centers. Whilst one Pd atom sat in the central of a bi-capped trigonal prism, thereby resulting in a formal 18-valence electron fragment, \{Pd(ZnMe)(2)(ZnCp*)(4)(GaMe)\}, the other Pd atom occupied one capping unit, thereby resulting in a highly unsaturated 12-valence electron fragment, \{Pd(GaCp*)\}. The bonding situation, as determined by atoms-in-molecules analysis (AIM), NBO partial charges, and molecular orbital (MO) analysis, pointed out that significant Pd-Pd interactions had a large stake in the stabilization of this unusual molecule. The characterization and quantum-chemical calculations of compound 1 revealed distinct similarities to related M/Zn/Ga Hume-Rothery intermetallic solid-state compounds, such as Ga/Zn-exchange reactions, the site-preferences of the Zn/Ga positions, and direct M-M bonding, which contributes to the overall stability of the metal-rich compound.},

In this study, a generally applicable fragmentation and computational protocol was established and validated by using octahedral spin crossover (SCO) complexes, as the transition temperature (T1/2) is sensitive to subtle changes in M‚àíL bonding. Specifically, EDA-NOCV analysis of Fe‚àíN bonds in five [FeII(Lazine)2(NCBH3)2], in both low-spin (LS) and paramagnetic high-spin (HS) states led to: 1)‚ÄÖdevelopment of a general, widely applicable, corrected M+L6 fragmentation, tested against a family of five LS [FeII(Lazine)3](BF4)2 complexes; this confirmed that three Lazine are stronger ligands (ŒîEorb,œÉ+œÄ=‚àí370‚ÄÖkcal‚Äâmol‚àí1) than 2‚ÄâLazine+2‚ÄâNCBH3 (=‚àí335‚ÄÖkcal‚Äâmol‚àí1), as observed. 2)‚ÄÖAnalysis of Fe‚àíL bonding on LS‚ÜíHS, reveals more ionic (ŒîEelstat) and less covalent (ŒîEorb) character (ŒîEelstat:ŒîEorb 55:45 LS‚Üí64:36 HS), mostly due to a big drop in œÉ (ŒîEorb,œÉ ‚Üì50‚Äâ\%; ‚àí310‚Üí‚àí145‚ÄÖkcal‚Äâmol‚àí1), and a drop in œÄ contributions (ŒîEorb,œÄ ‚Üì90‚Äâ\%; ‚àí30‚Üí‚àí3‚ÄÖkcal‚Äâmol‚àí1). 3)‚ÄÖStrong correlation of observed T1/2 and ŒîEorb,œÉ+œÄ, for both LS and HS families (R2=0.99 LS, R2=0.95 HS), but no correlation of T1/2 and ŒîŒîEorb,œÉ+œÄ(LS-HS) (R2=0.11). Overall, this study has established and validated an EDA-NOCV protocol for M‚àíL bonding analysis of any diamagnetic or paramagnetic, homoleptic or heteroleptic, octahedral transition metal complex. This new and widely applicable EDA-NOCV protocol holds great promise as a predictive tool.},

    abstract  = {The effect of para-substituent X on the electronic structure of sixteen tridentate 4-X-(2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl))-pyridine (bppX) ligands and the corresponding solution spin crossover [FeII(bppX)2]2+ complexes is analysed further, to supply quantitative insights into the effect of X on the œÉ-donor and œÄ-acceptor character of the Fe-NA(pyridine) bonds. EDA-NOCV on the sixteen LS complexes revealed that neither ŒîEorb,œÉ+œÄ (R2=0.48) nor ŒîEorb,œÄ (R2=0.31) correlated with the experimental solution T1/2 values (which are expected to reflect the ligand field imposed on the iron centre), but that ŒîEorb,œÉ correlates well (R2=0.82) and implies that as X changes from EDG‚ÜíEWG (Electron Donating to Withdrawing Group), the ligand becomes a better œÉ-donor. This counter-intuitive result was further probed by Mulliken analysis of the NA atomic orbitals: NA(px) involved in the Fe‚àíN œÉ-bond vs. the perpendicular NA(pz) employed in the ligand aromatic œÄ-system. As X changes EDG‚ÜíEWG, the electron population on NA(pz) decreases, making it a better œÄ-acceptor, whilst that in NA(px) increases, making it a better œÉ-bond donor; both increase ligand field, and T1/2 as observed. In 2016, Halcrow, Deeth and co-workers proposed an intuitively reasonable explanation of the effect of the para-X substituents on the

T1/2 values in this family of complexes, consistent with the calculated MO energy levels, that M‚ÜíL œÄ-backdonation dominates in these M‚àíL bonds. Here the quantitative EDA-NOCV analysis of the M‚àíL bond contributions provides a more complete, coherent and detailed picture of the relative impact of M‚àíL œÉ-versus œÄ-bonding in determining the observed T1/2, refining the earlier interpretation and revealing the importance of the œÉ-bonding. Furthermore, our results are in perfect agreement with the ŒîE(HS-LS) vs. œÉp+(X) correlation reported in their work.},

The apparently homogeneous solution of CsF in C6F6/hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) is the best reaction medium, but CsF in the biphasic mixture CH2Cl2/HFIP also provides good results. DFT studies suggest that fluoride initially attacks the Cu- rather than the C-atom of the transient donor/acceptor carbene intermediate. This unusual step is followed by 1,2-fluoride shift; for this migratory insertion to occur, the carbene must rotate about the Cu‚àíC bond to ensure orbital overlap. The directionality of this rotatory movement within the C2-symmetric binding site determines the sense of induction. This model is in excellent accord with the absolute configuration of the resulting product as determined by X-ray diffraction using single crystals of this a priori wax-like material grown by capillary crystallization.},

Through metallation of the mixture, the deprotonated species of both compounds could be obtained and isolated. Further reactions between the two metallated cyclic diarsanylsiloxanes (compounds 9 and 10) and (ClSiiPr2)2O both lead to the bicyclic compound As2- [(iPr2Si)2O]2 (11). Subsequent oxidative coupling of 9 or 10 with C2H4Br2 as reagent leads to intermolecular As‚ÄìAs bond formation, yielding the quite remarkable compound As6- [(iPr2Si)2O]3 (12), which features two siloxane-bridged As3 rings.

The calcula- tions suggest a reaction path leading to 4 that is in agreement with experimental observations. The theoretical data also provide information that explains the experimental finding that two different products for E = P and E = As are formed under the same oxidative reaction conditions.},

    abstract  = {This work proposes an effective thermal activation method with low technical effort for industrially pro¬≠ duced titanium-iron-manganese powders (TiFeMn) for hydrogen storage. In this context, the influence of temperature and particle size of TiFeMn on the activation process is systematically studied. The results obtained from this investigation suggest that the activation of the TiFeMn material at temperatures as low as 50 ¬∞C is already possible, with a combination of ‚ÄúDynamic‚Äù and ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù routines, and that an increase to 90 ¬∞C strongly reduces the incubation time for activation, i.e. the incubation time of the sample with the two routines at 90 ¬∞C is about 0.84 h, while ‚àº 277 h is required for the sample treated at 50 ¬∞C in both ‚ÄúDynamic‚Äù and ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù sequences. Selecting TiFeMn particles of larger size also leads to significant improvements in the activation performance of the investigated material. The proposed activation routine makes it possible to overcome the oxide layer existing on the compound surface, which acts as a diffusion barrier for the hydrogen atoms. This activation method induces further cracks and defects in the powder granules, gen¬≠ erating new surfaces for hydrogen absorption with greater frequency, and thus leading to faster sorption kinetics in the subsequent absorption-desorption cycles.},

    abstract   = {As early as 1975, Pitzer suggested that copernicium, flerovium, and oganesson are volatile substances behaving like noble gas because of their closed-shell configurations and accompanying relativistic effects. It is, however, precarious to predict the chemical bonding and physical behavior of a solid by knowledge of its atomic or molecular properties only. Copernicium and oganesson have been analyzed very recently by our group. Both are predicted to be semiconductors and volatile substances with rather low melting and boiling points, which may justify a comparison with the noble gas elements. Here, we study closed-shell flerovium in detail to predict its solid-state properties, including the melting point, by decomposing the total energy into many-body forces derived from relativistic coupled-cluster theory and from density functional theory. The convergence of such a decomposition for flerovium is critically analyzed, and the problem of using density functional theory is highlighted. We predict that flerovium in many ways does not behave like a typical noble gas element despite its closed-shell 7p21/2 configuration and resulting weak interactions. Unlike the case of noble gases, the many-body expansion in terms of the interaction energy does not converge smoothly. This makes the accurate prediction of phase transitions very difficult. Nevertheless, a first prediction by Monte Carlo simulation estimates the melting point at 284 ¬± 50 K. Furthermore, calculations for the electronic bandgap suggests that flerovium is a semiconductor similar to copernicium.},

    abstract  = {The analogy between ZnR fragments and the hydrogen radical represents a fruitful concept in organometallic synthesis. The organozinc(II) and -zinc(I) sources ZnMe2 (Me ¬º methyl) and [Zn2Cp*2] (Cp* ¬º pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) provide one-electron fragments \$ZnR (R ¬º Me, Cp*), which can be trapped by transition metal complexes [LaM], yielding [Lb(ZnR)n]. The addition of the dizinc compound [Zn2Cp*2] to coordinatively unsaturated [LaM] by the homolytic cleavage of the Zn‚ÄìZn bond can be compared to the classic oxidative addition reaction of H2, forming dihydride complexes [LaM(H)2]. It has also been widely shown that dihydrogen coordinates under preservation of the H‚ÄìH bond in the case of certain electronic properties of the transition metal fragment. The s-aromatic triangular clusters [Zn3Cp*3]+ and [Zn2CuCp*3] may be regarded as the first indication of this so far unknown, side-on coordination mode of [Zn2Cp*2]. With this background in mind the question arises if a series of complexes featuring the Zn2M structural motif can be prepared exhibiting a (more or less) intact Zn‚ÄìZn interaction, i.e. di-zinc complexes which are analogous to non-classical dihydrogen complexes of the Kubas type. In order to probe this idea, a series of interrelated organozinc nickel and palladium complexes and clusters were synthesized and characterized as model compounds: [Ni(ZnCp*)(ZnMe)(PMe3)3](1), [Ni(ZnCp*)2(ZnMe)2(PMe3)2](2), [\{Ni(CNtBu)2(m2-ZnCp*)(m2-ZnMe)\}2](3), [Pd(ZnCp*)4(CNtBu)2](4) and [Pd3Zn6(PCy3)2(Cp*)4](5). The dependence of Zn/Zn interactions as a function of the ligand environments and the metal centers was studied. Experimental X-ray crystallographic structural data and DFT calculations support the analogy between dihydrogen and dizinc transition metal complexes.},

    abstract  = {Quantum chemical calculations using density functional theory have been carried out for the cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) complexes of the group 11 atoms [TM(cAAC)2] (TM = Cu, Ag, Au) and their cations [TM(cAAC)2]+. The nature of the metal‚Äìligand bonding was investigated with the charge and energy decomposition analysis EDA-NOCV. The calculations show that the TM‚ÄìC bonds in the charged adducts [TM(cAAC)2]+ are significantly longer than in the neutral complexes [TM(cAAC)2], but the cations have much higher bond dissociation energies than the neutral molecules. The intrinsic interaction energies ŒîEint in [TM(cAAC)2]+ take place between TM+ in the 1S electronic ground state and (cAAC)2. In contrast, the metal‚Äìligand interactions in [TM(cAAC)2] involve the TM atoms in the excited 1P state yielding strong TM p(œÄ) ‚Üí (cAAC)2 œÄ backdonation, which is absent in the cations. The calculations suggest that the cAAC ligands in [TM(cAAC)2] are stronger œÄ acceptors than œÉ donors. The trends of the intrinsic interaction energies and the bond dissociation energies of the metal‚Äìligand bonds in [TM(cAAC)2] and [TM(cAAC)2]+ give the order Au {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Ag. Calculations at the nonrelativistic level give weaker TM‚ÄìC bonds, particularly for the gold complexes. The trend for the bond strength in the neutral and charged adducts without relativistic effects becomes Cu {\textgreater} Ag {\textgreater} Au. The EDA-NOCV calculations suggest that the weaker bonds at the nonrelativistic level are mainly due to stronger Pauli repulsion and weaker orbital interactions. The NBO picture of the C‚ÄìTM‚ÄìC bonding situation does not correctly represent the nature of the metal‚Äìligand interactions in [TM(cAAC)2].},

    abstract  = {The nature of the chemical bonds in E2 and tetrahedral E4 (E = N, P) has been analysed with the help of an energy decomposition method. The œÄ bonds in P2 are not particularly weak. On the contrary, the contribution of P‚ÄìP œÄ bonding to the chemical bond in P2 is even higher than the contribution of N‚ÄìN œÄ bonding to the chemical bond in N2. The higher stability of P4 (T d) and the much lower stability of N4 (T d) with regard to the diatomic species come from the substantially larger weakening of the N‚ÄìN œÉ-bonds compared with the P‚ÄìP œÉ-bonds in the tetrahedral species. The sum of the six P‚ÄìP œÉ-bond energies in P4 is higher than the sum of two œÉ- and four œÄ-bonds in two P2, but the six N‚ÄìN œÉ-bonds in N4 are weaker than two œÉ- and four œÄ-bonds in two N2. The crucial factor that leads to the weak N‚ÄìN bonds in N4, is the rather long N‚ÄìN bonds which are 32.8 \% longer than in N2. In contrast, the P‚ÄìP bonds in P4 are only 16.2 \% longer than in P2. Since the equilibrium distances in E2 and E4 are determined by Pauli repulsion, it can be concluded that the origin for the different stabilities of N4 and P4 relative to the diatomic molecules is the exchange repulsion. The nitrogen atoms encounter stronger Pauli repulsion, because the 2s and 2p valence orbitals have a similar radius while the 3s and 3p radii are more different.},

The nature of the [TM]-L bond is analyzed with the energy decomposition analysis - natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) method. The calculations reveal that transition metal compounds with ligands, that are typically classified as donor‚Äìacceptor complexes possessing dative bonds (Fischer-type carbenes and carbynes, alkene, and alkyne complexes) or as TM compounds with electron-sharing bonds (Schrock-type carbenes and carbynes, metallacyclopropanes, and metallacyclopropenes), exhibit significant differences between the orbital interactions when closed-shell or open shell fragments are used. Fischer-type carbene complexes have much lower orbital interaction (ŒîEorb) values when singlet fragments are employed compared to triplet fragments. In contrast, singlet and triplet fragments of Schrock-type carbene complexes give similar ŒîEorb values. The best description for Fischer-type carbyne complexes is found for neutral fragments in their electronic doublet state, which engage in a mixture of dative bonding (œÉ donation and œÄ backdonation) and one electron-sharing œÄ bond. The EDA-NOCV calculations of Schrock-type carbynes using open-shell species in their quartet electronic state give similar ŒîEorb values as neutral fragments in their electronic doublet state. Alkene and alkyne complexes, but also metallacyclic species, are best described with singlet fragments, but the difference between the ŒîEorb values for dative bonding and electron-sharing bonding using triplet fragments becomes much smaller for molecules that are considered as metallacycles.},

By computing relative energies of the hypothetical nonrelativistic gold(II) sulfate (AuNRSO4) in different structural arrangements and performing chemical bonding analyses employing the Electron Localization Function as well as the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules method, we show that the stability of the unsual AuSO4 bulk structure can be related to aurophilic interactions enabled by relativistic effects.

    abstract  = {The analysis of NEXAFS spectra acquired at the absorption edge of heteroatoms like fluorine, nitrogen, or oxygen enables the determination of the molecular orientation of individual compounds even in multinary structures. Such an analysis requires detailed knowledge about the nature of the corresponding electronic excitations, especially because 1s-œÄ* and 1s-œÉ* excitations frequently feature disparate transition dipole moments in planar molecules. Unlike intuitively assumed, the resulting dichroisms of both excitation types in planar systems are, however, not necessarily inverted. Instead, both the structure of the molecules and their alignment on the substrate determine the actual dichroisms. In this study, the NEXAFS signature and dichroisms of thin films of the organic n-type semiconductor perfluoropentacene (PFP) in different crystalline orientations at the carbon and fluorine absorption K-edge are thoroughly analyzed. For lying molecular orientations, an inverted dichroism at the fluorine K-edge compared to the carbon K-edge is found. In contrast, for upright molecular configurations the dichroisms at both absorption edges are similar. With the help of density functional theory methods, this behavior is explained by the different nature of the excitations. While at the carbon K-edge 1s-œÄ* excitations are most prominent, 1s-œÉ*-related signals are dominant at the fluorine K-edge. Computations of the NEXAFS signatures and corresponding excitations at different levels of theory are compared with particular focus on electronic relaxation. Energetic positions and oscillator strengths, especially for resonances of œÉ*-type, depend strongly on the theoretical approach whereas the œÄ*-related signals are barely affected by the methods applied in the present work. Similar effects were also found for the analysis of the smaller perfluoronaphthalene and are explained by the different relaxation effects for 1s-œÉ*- and 1s-œÄ*-type excitations. As the investigated acenes are representative model systems for œÄ-conjugated molecular semiconductors, the present findings are important for the understanding of the electronic properties and the application of NEXAFS for structural analysis in such materials.},

    abstract   = {The reaction mechanism for the rearrangement of the nitrate anion to its cis and trans peroxonitrite isomers is investigated in detail by quantum theoretical methods. The electronic ground state potential energy hypersurface (PES) features a bifurcation point along the minimum energy path at high energy, while the intrinsic reaction path moves the bifurcation point towards the transition state (TS) between the two peroxynitrite isomers. Coupled-cluster calculations reveal a high-lying transition state (4.6‚ÄÖeV) for the major photochemical isomerization pathway via an S1/S0 conical intersection, explaining why electronic excitation of the bright singlet states with Œª=200‚Äì270‚ÄÖnm is required to trigger formation of peroxinitrite, while excitation of the weak band around 300‚ÄÖnm (wavelengths {\textgreater}270‚ÄÖnm) does instead lead to non-radiative regeneration of NO3‚àí. The influence of the aqueous solution is considered using polarizable continuum solvation in combination with explicitly solvated model systems. Despite the charged and polar nature of nitrate, we find that solvent effects exert a suprisingly small influence, neither changing the shape of the PES, nor affecting the nature of the excited states.},

    abstract   = {Oganesson (Og) is the most recent addition to Group‚ÄÖ18. Investigations of its atomic electronic structure have unraveled a tremendous impact of relativistic effects, raising the question whether the heaviest noble gas lives up to its position in the periodic table. To address the issue, we explore the electronic structure of bulk Og by means of relativistic Kohn‚ÄìSham density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory in the form of the GW method. Calculating the band structure of the noble-gas solids from Ne to Og, we demonstrate excellent agreement for the band gaps of the experimentally known solids from Ne to Xe and provide values of 7.1‚ÄÖeV and 1.5‚ÄÖeV for the unknown solids of Rn and Og. While this is in line with periodic trends for Rn, the band gap of Og completely breaks with these trends. The surprisingly small band gap of Og moreover means that, in stark contrast to all other noble-gas solids, the solid form of Og is a semiconductor.},

The new compounds were obtained by treatment of various GaCp* ligated precursors with suitable amounts of ZnMe2 to exchange Ga against Zn. This exchange follows a strict Ga:Zn ratio of 1:2. Accordingly, a Ga/Zn mixed compound [\{Cp*Ru(GaCp*)(ZnCp*)(ZnCl)2\}2] can be obtained if the amount of ZnMe2 is reduced so that one GaCp* remains coordinated to the transition metal. All new compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy as well as by single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques, if applicable. The coordination polyhedra of [Cp*M(ZnR)5] can be derived from the pseudo homoleptic parent compound [Ru(ZnCp*)4(ZnMe)6], as emphasized by continuous shape measures analysis (CShM). Computational investigations at the density functional theory (DFT) level of theory were performed, revealing no significant attractive interaction of the zinc atoms and therefore these compounds are best described as classical complexes, rather than cluster compounds. The Ru-L bond strength follow the order Cp* {\textgreater} ZnCl {\textgreater} ZnMe {\textgreater} ZnCp*.},

Compounds 1-Zn and 1-Ga are very closely related and differ only by one Zn or Ga atom in the group 12/13 metal shell (Zn/Ga) around the two Ni centers. Accordingly, 1-Zn is EPR-active and 1-Ga is EPR-silent. The compounds were derived as a crystalline product mixture. All new compounds were characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometric analysis using liquid-injection field desorption ionization, and elemental analysis, and their molecular structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. In addition, the electronic structure has been investigated by DFT and QTAIM calculations, which suggest that there is a Ni1-Ni2 binding interaction. Similar to Zn-rich intermetallic phases of the Hume-Rothery type, the transition metals (here Ni) are distributed in a matrix of Zn atoms to yield highly Zn-coordinated environments. The organic residues, ancillary ligands (Me, Cp*, and toluene), can be viewed as the "protecting" shell of the 10-metal-atom core structures. The soft and flexible binding properties of Cp* and transferability of Me substituents between groups 12 and 13 are essential for the success of this precedence-less type of cluster formation reaction.},

Two separated VSCCs present in the non-bonding region of the central silicon are indicative for two lone pairs. In the experiment, both the two crystallographically independent Si-C bond lengths and ellipticities vary notably. It is only the cyclohexyl derivative that shows significant differences in these values, both in the silylones and the germylones. Only by calculating increasing spheres of surrounding point charges we were able to recover the changes in the properties of the charge density distribution caused by weak intermolecular interactions. The nitrogen-carbene-carbon bond seems to have a significant double-bond character, indicating a singlet state for the carbene carbon, which is needed for donor acceptor bonding. Thus the sum of bond angles at the nitrogen atoms seems to be a reasonable estimate for singlet versus triplet state of cAACs.},

The calculated melting temperature are 201(3) K and 201(6) K from bulk simulations and from extrapolation of finite cluster values, respectively.

In hervorragender √úbereinstimmung miteinander sagen beide Methoden voraus, dass Og unter Normalbedingungen ein Feststoff mit einem Schmelzpunkt von \% 325 K ist. Ohne Ber√ºcksichtigung der relativistischen Effekte w√§re Og mit einem Schmelzpunkt von 220 K gasf√ßrmig, wie es f√ºr ein typisches Edelgaselement zu erwarten w√§re.

    abstract   = {Oganesson (Og) is the last entry into the Periodic Table completing the seventh period of elements and group 18 of the noble gases. Only five atoms of Og have been successfully produced in nuclear collision experiments, with an estimate half-life for 219148Og of 0.69√æ√Ä00::6242 ms.[1] With such a short lifetime, chemical and physical properties inevitably have to come from accurate relativistic quantum theory. Here, we employ two complementary computational approaches, namely parallel tempering Monte-Carlo (PTMC) simulations and first-principles thermodynamic integration (TI), both calibrated against a highly accurate coupled-cluster reference to pin-down the melting and boiling points of this super-heavy element. In excellent agreement, these approaches show Og to be a solid at ambient conditions with a melting point of \% 325 K. In contrast, calculations in the nonrelativistic limit reveal a melting point for Og of 220 K, suggesting a gaseous state as expected for a typical noble gas element. Accordingly, relativistic effects shift the solid-to-liquid phase transition by about 100 K.},

    abstract  = {The solid-to-liquid phase transition for krypton and xenon is studied by means of parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations based on an accurate description of the atomic interactions within a many-body ansatz using relativistic coupled-cluster theory. These high-level data were subsequently fitted to computationally efficient extended Lennard-Jones and extended Axilrod-Teller-Muto types of interaction potentials. Solid-state calculations demonstrate that the many-body decomposition of the interaction energy converges well for the heavier rare gas solids, leading to solid-state properties in good agreement with experiment. The results show that it suffices to include two- and three-body interactions only for the melting simulation. The melting of the bulk is simulated for cells with cubic periodic boundary conditions, as well as within a finite cluster approach. For the latter, melting of spherical magic number clusters with increasing cluster size is studied, and the melting temperatures are obtained from extrapolation to the bulk. The calculated melting temperatures for the cluster extrapolation (the periodic approach values corrected for superheating are set in parentheses) are Tm=113.7 K (110.9 K) and Tm=160.8 K (156.1 K) for krypton and xenon, respectively. Both are in very good agreement with corresponding experimental values of 115.75 and 161.40 K.},

    abstract  = {A systematic quantum chemical study of the bonding in d6-transition-metal complexes, containing phosphine-stabilized, main-group-element fragments, (R3P)2E, as ligands (E=AlH, BH, CH+, C), is reported. By using energy decomposition analysis, it is demonstrated that a strong M‚àíE bond is accompanied by weak P‚àíE bonds, and vice versa. Although the Al‚àíM bond is, for example, found to be very strong, the weak Al‚àíP bond suggests that the corresponding metal complexes will not be stable towards phosphine dissociation. The interaction energies for the boron(I)-based ligand are lower, but still higher than those for two-carbon-based ligands. For neutral ligands, electrostatic interactions are the dominating contributions to metal‚Äìligand bonding, whereas for the cationic ligand a significant destabilization, with weak orbital and even weaker electrostatic metal‚Äìligand interactions, is observed. Finally, for iron(II) complexes, it is demonstrated that different reactivity patterns are expected for the four donor groups: the experimentally observed reversible E‚àíH reductive elimination of the borylene-based ligand (E=BH) exhibits significantly higher barriers for the protonated carbodiphosphorane (CDP) ligand (E=CH) and would proceed through different intermediates and transition states. For aluminum, such reaction pathways are not feasible (E=AlH). Moreover, it is demonstrated that the metal hydrido complexes with CDP ligands might not be stable towards reduction and isomerization to a protonated CDP ligand and a reduced metal center.},
