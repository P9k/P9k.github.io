I am Group Leader for <b>Computational Materials Design of Metal Hydrides</b> at the <a href='https://www.hereon.de/hydrogen'>Institute of Hydrogen Technology</a> within the <a href='https:www.hereon.de'>Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon</a>.

Our group aims at establishing a computational methodology that enables <b>scale-bridging modelling of metal hydrides materials for hydrogen storage</b>. Click here to read more about our approach and learn why metal hydrides are an excellent choice for safe, long-term hydrogen storage.

As a computational chemist/quantum chemist by training, I have major expertise in <b>chemical bonding analysis</b> by means of first-principles methods, which I utilize to understand the interatomic interactions in transtion metal complexes and superheavy elements more deeply and offer chemically intuitive explanations.

Since October 2019, I am coordinator of the <b>BMBF project D-NZ-H2-CENTER</b>, a joint project between Hereon and the <a href='https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/otago824063.html'>University of Otago (Dunedin, New Zealand)</a>. This bilateral German-New Zealand collaboration on green hydrogen has the goal of establishing a physical green hydrogen research presence in Dunedin and aims at promoting German-New Zealand academic and industrial interactions on the topic of green hydrogen (generation, storage, utilization).

Feel free to get in touch if you want to discuss a scientific collaboration or have any questions! ðŸ˜Š
